            My name is Benjamin Roque and I'm a student from Lakeland, Florida. I'm a half West Indian and half Filipino first generation child to my lovely parents. I grew up with two older sisters and two beautiful dogs. One things that's stayed with me throughout my life is my love of anything art. When I got to middle school I really dove into this interest taking art classes up through my senior year. I took AP 2-D Studio Design and AP Drawing my junior and senior year, scoring a 5 and 4 on my porfolios. These classes helped me build a passion for art that also told me I shouldn't go to medical school like my parents wanted me to.<br>

            This is where I began researching graphic design. I had taken an InDesign course many moons ago in my freshman year, but despite not remembering much about the program, I remembered enjoying it, especially the lessons about layout and color use. As a student in the Polk State digital media program, I want to develop a skilset that allows me to focus on things like layout and color, but also a wider variety of skills that allow me to communicate a clients needs effectively. Outside of my life as an aspiring designer, I <em>love</em> coffee and chai! I have  a part time job, and I love music!
